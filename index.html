            <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>

            <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng,
                literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
                historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
                nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
                BC,[4] with
                selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of
                the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
                border walls.
                The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).Apart from defense, other
                purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition
                of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control
                of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were
                enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
                through the
                means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation
                corridor.

            <h2>Petra</h2>

            <p>Petra Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batraʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock", Nabataean:,
                originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō,[3][4] is a historic and archaeological city in
                southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
                forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[5] The
                area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[6] and the Nabataeans might have settled
                in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[7] Archaeological
                work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[8] by
                which time Petra had become their capital.[6] The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's
                proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.[6][9]
                The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their
                wealth.

            <h2>Colosseum</h2>

            <p>The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical amphitheatre
                in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
                amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age.
                Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under
                his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of
                Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian
                dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian:
                Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association
                with their family name (Flavius).

            <h2>Chichén Itzá</h2>

            <p>Chichén Itzá[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large
                pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is
                located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]
                Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900)
                through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD
                900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
                Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican
                styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central
                Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the
                result of cultural diffusion.

            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a
                2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[2][3] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is
                the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba
                Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba
                River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain
                climate.[5](For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the
                name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/[6][7] or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/,[7][8] in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu]

            <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>

            <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble
                mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in
                1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
                Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
                (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
                three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of
                the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans
                under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court architect.

            <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>

            <p>Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is
                an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski
                and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert
                Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the
                statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92
                ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ The Redeemer differs
                considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand
                and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the design, it later
                changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
