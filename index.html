            <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>

            <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng,
                literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
                historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
                nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
                BC,[4] with
                selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of
                the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
                border walls.
                The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).Apart from defense, other
                purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition
                of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control
                of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were
                enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
                through the
                means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation
                corridor.
                The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from
                Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to
                Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe;
                spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is
                generally
                recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.[8]

            <h2>Petra</h2>

            <p>Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batraʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock", Nabataean: 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎),
                originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō,[3][4] is a historic and archaeological city in
                southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
                forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[5] The
                area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[6] and the Nabataeans might have settled
                in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[7] Archaeological
                work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[8] by
                which time Petra had become their capital.[6] The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's
                proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.[6][9]
                The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their
                wealth. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and were
                able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly
                skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD,
                when its Al-Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was
                constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10]

                <h3>10 Interesting facts about Petra</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>1. During the first centuries BC to AD, Petra is believed to have been home to 20,000 – 30,000
                        people and was an important trading city. It then sat uninhabited for over five centuries until
                        rediscovered by a Swiss explorer in 1812, hence the name the ‘Lost City’.
                    </li>

                    <li>The name Petra originates from the Greek word ‘petros’ meaning rocks. It is also known as
                        Al-Batra in Arabic.
                    </li>

                    <li>Although a desert, the Nabateans (inhabitants of Petra) were efficient water collectors and were
                        even able to grow gardens in the area.
                    </li>

                    <li>Petra became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 as well as one of the New Seven Wonders of the
                        World in 2007.
                    </li>

                    <li>Petra is also called the ‘Rose City’ due to the colour of its rocks, which take on a red-pink
                        hue at sunset and sunrise.
                    </li>

                    <li>The entrance to the city of Petra is by a narrow passage cut through the sandstone as a result
                        of years of rain and wind. This passage is known as the ‘Siq’, which simply means ‘gorge’.
                    </li>

                    <li>Between 1BC and 8AD Petra suffered severe earthquakes and in AD 363 it is believed about half of
                        the city was destroyed. This led to raiding and theft of artefacts from the site.
                    </li>

                    <li>Petra has been the location for a number of Hollywood films including Indiana Jones and The
                        Mummy Returns. The site has also featured in TV programmes, music videos and even video games
                    </li>

                    <li>It is believed that Petra was established in 312 BC, making it one of the oldest cities in the
                        world.
                    </li>

                    <li> Using satellite imagery, in 2016 archaeologists discovered a large and previously unknown
                        monumental structure buried beneath the sands of Petra.

            <h2>Colosseum</h2>

            <p>The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical amphitheatre
                in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
                amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age.
                Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under
                his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of
                Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian
                dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian:
                Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association
                with their family name (Flavius).
                The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could
                hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average
                audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal
                hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly
                mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was
                later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a
                quarry, and a Christian shrine.

                <h3>10 Interesting facts about the Colosseum </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li> Built between 72 AD and 80 AD, the Colosseum consists of stone and concrete. It was constructed
                        by tens of thousands of Jewish slaves under the rule of Emperor Vespasian.
                    </li>

                    <li>Measuring 189 metres long, 156 metres wide and 50 metres in height, the Colosseum is the largest
                        amphitheater in the world.
                    </li>

                    <li>The Colosseum could seat around 50,000 spectators for a variety of events. These included
                        gladiator contests, animal hunts and re-enactments of famous battles. There were even mock sea
                        battles as they flooded the Colosseum with water.
                    </li>

                    <li>The arena had 36 trap doors for special effects, as well as many underground passages and rooms
                        to hold wild animals and gladiators before the games began.
                    </li>

                    <li>In order to gain popularity, emperors organised and paid for events in the Colosseum themselves.
                        Entry was free for all ancient Romans and they sometimes had free food throughout the spectacles
                        too.
                    </li>

                    <li>The Colosseum had a velarium, a type of awning used in Roman times. This pulled over the top of
                        the seating area to shade the spectators and protect them from the scorching sun.
                    </li>

                    <li>The animals brought to fight in the arena came from all over the Roman Empire. They included big
                        cats such as lions and tigers, as well as rhinos, crocodiles and bears.
                    </li>

                    <li> Some of the games in the Colosseum lasted up to 100 days. However, gladiator contests stopped
                        in 435 AD and the last animal hunts were in 532 CE. This was partly due to the cost of acquiring
                        animals and gladiators, alongside maintaining the arena.
                    </li>

                    <li>It’s estimated that over 400,000 people and over a million wild animals died during the
                        centuries that the games took place.
                    </li>

                    <li>Natural disasters and vandalism destroyed approximately two-thirds of the Colosseum. But it was
                        the 847 AD and 1231 AD earthquakes that did the most damage that you can see today.

            <h2>Chichén Itzá</h2>

            <p>Chichén Itzá[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large
                pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is
                located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]
                Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900)
                through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD
                900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
                Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican
                styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central
                Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the
                result of cultural diffusion.
                Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great
                cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most
                diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of
                architectural styles at the site.[3]
                The ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's
                Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land
                under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of
                Yucatán.[nb 2]

            <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>

            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a
                2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[2][3] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is
                the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba
                Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba
                River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain
                climate.[5](For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the
                name is
                pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/[6][7] or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/,[7][8] in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or
                [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu],[9] and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu)[10] as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].)
                The Inca civilization had no written language and no European visited the site until the 19th century,
                so far as is known, so there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names of the
                buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists on the
                basis of physical evidence, including tombs at the site.
                Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor
                Pachacuti (1438–1472). The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the
                time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c.
                1420–1532.[11] Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna
                Picchu by the Inca, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.[12][13]

                <h3>10 Interesting facts about the Machu Picchu</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>In the Quechua Indian language, “Machu Picchu” means “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.”</li>

                    <li>Machu Picchu is made up of more than 150 buildings ranging from baths and houses to temples and
                        sanctuaries.
                    </li>

                    <li>The compound contains more than 100 separate flights of stairs. Most of the individual
                        staircases were carved from one slab of stone.
                    </li>

                    <li>Although many of the stones that were used to build the city were more than 50 pounds, it is
                        believed that no wheels were used to transport these rocks up the mountain. Rather, it is
                        thought that hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.
                    </li>

                    <li>Many different theories exist about Machu Picchu’s purpose—a royal estate and a secret
                        ceremonial center among them.
                    </li>

                    <li> The Incas were some of the best masons in the world. The structures were so well built with a
                        technique called ashlar (stones that are cut to fit together without mortar) that not even a
                        knife blade can fit in between stones.
                    </li>

                    <li> Machu Picchu was only known locally until Yale Professor Hiram Bingham re-discovered the site
                        in 1911. His book, The Lost City of the Incas, was based on his findings.
                    </li>

                    <li>A long-standing dispute between Peru and Yale University has existed over the artifacts
                        collected by Bingham during his exploration of the site. Yale maintains that they own the items
                        while Peru insists they were given on loan.
                    </li>

                    <li>Machu Picchu was an astronomical observatory, and its sacred Intihuatana stone accurately
                        indicates the two equinoxes. Twice a year, the sun sits directly over the stone creating no
                        shadow.
                    </li>

                    <li>Unfortunately, most cities built by the Inca civilization were destroyed by the Spanish
                        conquest. Machu Picchu was in a hidden location—invisible from below—and not found, making it
                        one of the most well-preserved Inca cities and an archeological gem.

            <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>

            <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble
                mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in
                1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
                Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
                (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
                three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of
                the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans
                under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court architect.
                Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art
                in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by
                many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal
                attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7
                Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                <ol>
                    <li>Taj Mahal is taller than Delhi’s Qutub Minar</li>

                    <li>The colour of the monument keeps changing throughout the day</li>

                    <li>It is believed that around INR 32 million was spent to complete the construction of this white
                        mausoleum (in 1653). Today, the cost of building the Taj would be somewhere around INR 70
                        billion (nearly $1 billion).
                    </li>

                    <li>The Taj Mahal is adorned with more than 40 types of precious and semi-precious stones, including
                        pearls, diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, among others.
                    </li>

                    <li>Elephants played an important role in building the Taj Mahal. As per the reports, nearly 1000
                        elephants were used to transfer the construction material from one place to another during that
                        time.
                    </li>

                    <li>Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah Jahan, after whom the Taj Mahal is built, actually died during
                        the birth of her 14th child, and this white beauty was built by Shah Jahan in her memory.
                    </li>

                    <li>It took around 20 years to complete the Taj Mahal and some 20000 workers were employed in the
                        construction work.
                    </li>

                    <li>In order to build the symbol of love, the materials were all transported from Punjab,
                        Rajastha,.Sri Lanka, Tibet and China, to name a few.

            <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>

            <p>Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is
                an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski
                and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert
                Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the
                statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92
                ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ The Redeemer differs
                considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand
                and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the design, it later
                changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
                The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the
                700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de
                Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both
                Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.[6]

                <h3>10 Interesting facts about the Christ the Redeemer</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Christ the Redeemer was built using reinforced concrete and has an outer shell of 6 million
                        soapstone tiles. It’s believed that the workers who made these tiles occasionally wrote notes on
                        the back, meaning this iconic landmark is full of hidden messages.
                    </li>

                    <li> Due to the statue’s mountaintop position, it’s prone to lightning strikes and gets hit around
                        three to six times a year. Prior to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, lightning struck and broke one
                        of the statue’s thumbs.
                    </li>

                    <li>The original design of the statue was different from what we see today. It was intended for
                        Christ to be holding a globe in one hand and a cross in the other, rather than two open arms.
                    </li>

                    <li>Christ the Redeemer was not actually built in Brazil. It was first made in France by French
                        sculptor Paul Landowski who created the statue in clay pieces. These were then shipped to Brazil
                        to be remade with reinforced concrete by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French
                        engineer Albert Caquot.
                    </li>

                    <li>Construction of the statue took 9 years. Beginning in 1922, it was finally finished in 1931 at a
                        cost of $250,000 US.
                    </li>

                    <li>The statue boasts an impressive title. In 2007 it was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the
                        World alongside top sights such as the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu and the Rose City of
                        Petra in Jordan.
                    </li>

                    <li>It’s one of the largest statues of Jesus and the tallest art deco statue in the world. Christ
                        the Redeemer reaches a height of 30 metres and boasts an arm span of 28 metres.
                    </li>

                    <li>Housing prices in Rio de Janeiro have increased simply if the property has a view of Christ the
                        Redeemer. Apartments with even a slight view of the statue are higher than those with the same
                        location and size but no view.
                    </li>

                    <li>The light-coloured stone used to build the statue was taken from a quarry near the city of Ouro
                        Preto. However, this stone is in short supply and restoration works are having to be done using
                        different types. As a result, stone in a darker shade is slowly replacing the original, meaning
                        Christ the Redeemer is gradually getting darker.
                    </li>

                    <li> Each year, Christ the Redeemer is visited by nearly 2 million people. The record number of
                        visitors to the statue in a single day was a huge 14,000 during Easter of 2011.
