            <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>

            <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: Ëê¨ÈáåÈï∑Âüé; simplified Chinese: ‰∏áÈáåÈïøÂüé; pinyin: W√†nl«ê Ch√°ngch√©ng,
                literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
                historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
                nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
                BC,[4] with
                selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220‚Äì206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of
                the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
                border walls.
                The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644).Apart from defense, other
                purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition
                of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control
                of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were
                enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
                through the
                means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation
                corridor.
                The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from
                Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino‚ÄìRussian border in the north to
                Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe;
                spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is
                generally
                recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.[8]

            <h2>Petra</h2>

            <p>Petra (Arabic: Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ™Ÿíÿ±ÿßÿ°, romanized: Al-Batra æ; Ancient Greek: Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒ±, "Rock", Nabataean: ê¢õê¢öê¢ìê¢à‚Äé),
                originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqƒìm≈ç,[3][4] is a historic and archaeological city in
                southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
                forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[5] The
                area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[6] and the Nabataeans might have settled
                in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[7] Archaeological
                work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[8] by
                which time Petra had become their capital.[6] The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's
                proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.[6][9]
                The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their
                wealth. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and were
                able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly
                skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD,
                when its Al-Khazneh structure ‚Äì believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV ‚Äì was
                constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10]

            <h2>Colosseum</h2>

            <p>The Colosseum (/Àåk…íl…ôÀàsiÀê…ôm/ KOL-…ô-SEE-…ôm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosÀàs…õÀêo]) is an elliptical amphitheatre
                in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
                amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age.
                Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r.‚Äâ69‚Äì79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under
                his successor and heir, Titus (r.‚Äâ79‚Äì81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of
                Domitian (r.‚Äâ81‚Äì96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian
                dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian:
                Anfiteatro Flavio [a…±fiteÀàaÀêtro ÀàflaÀêvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association
                with their family name (Flavius).
                The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could
                hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average
                audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal
                hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly
                mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was
                later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a
                quarry, and a Christian shrine.

            <h2>Chich√©n Itz√°</h2>

            <p>Chich√©n Itz√°[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large
                pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is
                located in Tin√∫m Municipality, Yucat√°n State, Mexico.[1]
                Chich√©n Itz√° was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600‚Äì900)
                through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800‚Äì900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD
                900‚Äì1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
                Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican
                styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central
                Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the
                result of cultural diffusion.
                Chich√©n Itz√° was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great
                cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most
                diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of
                architectural styles at the site.[3]
                The ruins of Chich√©n Itz√° are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's
                Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land
                under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of
                Yucat√°n.[nb 2]

            <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>

            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a
                2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[2][3] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is
                the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba
                Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba
                River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain
                climate.[5](For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the
                name is
                pronounced /Àåm…ëÀêt ÉuÀê ÀàpiÀêt ÉuÀê/[6][7] or /Àåm√¶t ÉuÀê ÀàpiÀêkt ÉuÀê/,[7][8] in Spanish as [Ààmat Éu Ààpit Éu] or
                [Ààmat Éu Ààpi…£t Éu],[9] and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu)[10] as [Ààmat É ä Ààp…™kt É ä].)
                The Inca civilization had no written language and no European visited the site until the 19th century,
                so far as is known, so there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names of the
                buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists on the
                basis of physical evidence, including tombs at the site.
                Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor
                Pachacuti (1438‚Äì1472). The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the
                time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c.
                1420‚Äì1532.[11] Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna
                Picchu by the Inca, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.[12][13]

            <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>

            <p>The Taj Mahal (/Àåt…ëÀêd í m…ôÀàh…ëÀêl, Àåt…ëÀê í-/; lit.‚Äâ'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble
                mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in
                1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.‚Äâ1628‚Äì1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
                Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
                (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
                three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of
                the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ‚Çπ32 million, which in 2020 would be
                approximately ‚Çπ70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans
                under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor‚Äôs court architect.
                Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art
                in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by
                many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal
                attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7
                Wonders of the World (2000‚Äì2007) initiative.

            <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>

            <p>Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [Ààk…æistu  Åed·∫ΩÀàto Å]) is
                an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski
                and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert
                Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the
                statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92
                ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ The Redeemer differs
                considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand
                and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the design, it later
                changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
                The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the
                700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de
                Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both
                Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.[6]
