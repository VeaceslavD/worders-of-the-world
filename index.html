                <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>

                <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ
                    Chángchéng,
                    literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
                    historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against
                    various
                    nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
                    BC,[4] with
                    selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little
                    of
                    the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches
                    of
                    border walls.

                <p>Petra Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batraʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock", Nabataean:,
                    originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō,[3][4] is a historic and archaeological city
                    in
                    southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by
                    mountains
                    forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[5]
                    The
                    area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[6] and the Nabataeans might have
                    settled
                    in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.

                <p>The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical
                    amphitheatre
                    in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
                    amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its
                    age.
                    Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD
                    under
                    his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of
                    Domitian (r. 81–96).[3]

                <p>Chichén Itzá[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large
                    pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site
                    is
                    located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]
                    Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD
                    600–900)
                    through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period
                    (c. AD
                    900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in
                    central
                    Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.

                    River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain

                    marble
                    mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned
                    in
                    1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
                    Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
                    17-hectare
                    (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded
                    on
                    three sides by a crenellated wall.
                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of
                    the project for another 10 years.
